#### **How To Program**

Programming can be done in two simple ways, either in Lua or through Arduino IDE, whichever you are comfortable with.

In case you want to use Lua, then this [LuaLoader](http://benlo.com/esp8266/index.html#LuaLoader) can be a good IDE to start with.

Else, you can use Arduino IDE by following the steps [here](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager)

This repository is aimed at documenting my various codes for the esp8266.
